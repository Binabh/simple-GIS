# What is this?
A simple tool written in Python to view, manipulate and convert geo-data.
# What on useful does this tool do?
Nothing much! UNLESS you are into:
- viewing shapefiles
- measuring distances between places in shapefiles
- saving shapefiles as shapefiles (I don't know why you would want to do that)
- saving shapefiles as geojson ( This might be actually a useful feature)
